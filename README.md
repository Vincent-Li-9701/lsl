> Jesse Mu, Percy Liang, and Noah Goodman. Shaping Visual Representations with Language for Few-shot Classification. https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02683

sub-repository since the codebases extended in each project have different
licenses.

Shapeworld experiments are located in `shapeworld`. Birds experiments are
forthcoming (will be located in `birds`).
